# Enunciate RAML Module
A RAML generator for <a href="http://enunciate.webcohesion.com/">Enunciate</a>. Based on the 
<a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.raml/raml-emitter/2.0.0">RAML Emitter</a>
for <a href="https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-for-jax-rs">RAML for JAX-RS</a>.
This was a mistake! The implementation was tied too tightly to JAX-RS.
